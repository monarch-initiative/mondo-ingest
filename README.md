# Mondo Source Ingest

This repo is dedicated to the integration of various clinical terminologies and ontologies into Mondo. For more details

Work on the Mondo Source Ingest is funded by the _NHGRI Phenomics First Grant 1RM1HG010860-01_.

## Prerequisites
Python is a dev dependency. It's not needed to run the docker containers, but needed for local development situations 
/ debugging.
1. Python 3.9+
2. Docker
3. Docker images  
  One or both of the following, depending on if you want to run the stable build `latest` or `dev`:
    - a. `docker pull obolibrary/odkfull:latest`

## Running
### Full build

## Reports
A variety of reports are committed as static files in `src/ontology/reports/`, but some additional reports get rendered 
into markdown pages as noted below.

### Mapping progress report
The [mapping progress report](./docs/reports/unmapped.md) consists lists of all unmapped terms fo each ontology, as well 
as a table of statistics showing total number of terms, excluded terms, deprecated terms, and unmapped terms.

### Mapped deprecated terms
The [_mapped deprecated terms_ page](./docs/reports/mapped_deprecated.md) contains a table of statistics showing total number of deprecated terms that 
have existing xrefs in Mondo, for each ontology. There is also a link to a page for each ontology which shows the term 
IDs and their corresponding mapped Mondo ID(s).
