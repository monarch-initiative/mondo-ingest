Other components such as hair follicles and shafts, mesenchymal derivatives (blood vessels and fibrous tissue) and occasionally nerve fibers can be observed. Inflamed granulation tissue containing mixed neutrophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes is consistently found in the tract. It can also be associated with an intradural dermoid cyst. This malformation is at risk to cause intrathecal infections (meningitis, empyema) that justify a prophylactic surgery. | MONDO:0958259|MONDO:8000034|MONDO:8000030               |

The stalk-like connection consists of a fibroneural tract (mainly composed of fibrous attenuated mesenchymal tissue and neural elements without an epithelial lining) connecting the skin lesion to the underlying dorsal surface of the spinal cord. Fibroneural stalk varies in thickness and complexity and they pass through the deep fascia, a bifid lamina/ the interspinous ligament, and the dura. It can be associated with filum anomaly. Chiari II malformation is not present.                                                                  | MONDO:0958259|MONDO:8000033                             |

The spinal cord is typically attenuated and the limit between its end and the fatty filum is hard to distinguish. There are no additional spinal cord malformation, but it can be associated with vertebral abnormalities, anorectal malformation or other syndromic condition. It is named transitional for its intermediate image between an isolated filum lipoma and a terminal conus region lipoma.                                                                                                                            | MONDO:8000034|MONDO:8000030                             |

It contains non-functional neural tissue and is typically isolated. The diagnostic is suggested by attenuated conus without fat, further confirmed by pathological analysis (glioneuronal core with ependyma-lined lumen, nerve roots, and dorsal root ganglia). Differential diagnostic with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is mandatory as neuroimaging fails to distinguish it from functional conus.                                                                                                                                            | MONDO:0958259|MONDO:8000034|MONDO:8000030               |
