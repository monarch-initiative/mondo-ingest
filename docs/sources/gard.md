# MONDO - GARD Alignment

**Source name:** GARD

**Source description:** The GARD mapping is mainly curated through the GARD-ORDO and GARD-OMIM mappings. From the GARD developers, we have confirmed that, For a given GARD ID,  GARD guarantees no other concept will be assigned in the future.   The concept will not be assigned to a different GARD ID, but this GARD ID may be retired  when a similar but more accurate concept is created under a new GARD ID to replace this GARD ID.
