NEW: this mapping interpretation can be added with high confidence
AMBIGUOUS: the source ontology has different interpretations (e.g. exact,
broad) for the same term pair. If you get this then you should tidy up your
inputs
CONFLICT: the source ontology mapping interpretation is different from what
is inferred to be the correct one
REJECT: a CONFLICT in which the source interpretation is non-exact
