  The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) provides a common language that allows health professionals to 
  share standardized information across the world. The eleventh revision contains around 17 000 unique codes, more than 
  120 000 codable terms and is now entirely digital.Feb 11, 2022
  
  This data source in particular is the ICD11 foundation, not one of its linearizations.

  _Preprocessing_  
  In the [monarch-initiative/icd11](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/icd11) repo, We remove unicode characters and 
  then remove equivalent class statements as discussed below. 
  
  _Equivalent classes_  
  We remove all equivalent class statements as they are not unique and result in unintended node merges. For example 
  `icd11.foundation:2000662282` (_Occupant of pick-up truck or van injured in collision with car, pick-up truck or van: 
  person on outside of vehicle injured in traffic accident_) has the same exact equivalent concept expression as 
  `icd11.foundation:1279712844` (_Occupant of pick-up truck or van injured in collision with two- or three- wheeled motor 
  vehicle: person on outside of vehicle injured in traffic accident_).
