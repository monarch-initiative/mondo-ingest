Participation is involvement in a life situation.
Activity limitations are difficulties an individual may have in executing activities.
Participation restrictions are problems an individual may experience in involvement in life situations.
The domains for the Activities and Participation component are given in a single list that covers the full range of life areas (from basic learning and watching to composite areas such as social tasks). This component can be used to dedefinition activities (a) or participation (p) or both.
The two qualifiers for the Activities and Participation component are the performance qualifier and the capacity qualifier. The performance qualifier describes what an individual does in his or her current environment. Because the current environment brings in a societal context, performance as recorded by this qualifier can also be understood as ""involvement in a life situation"" or ""the lived experience"" of people in the actual context in which they live. This context includes the environmental factors - all aspects of the physical, social and attitudinal world, which can be coded using the Environmental Factors component.
The capacity qualifier describes an individual's ability to execute a task or an action. This qualifier identifies the highest probable level of functioning that a person may reach in a given domain at a given moment. Capacity is measured in a uniform or standard environment, and thus reflects the environmentally adjusted ability of the individual. The Environmental Factors component can be used to describe the features of this uniform or standard environment.
Both capacity and performance qualifiers can be used with and without assistive devices or personal assistance, and in accordance with the following scale:"

Impairments are problems in body function or structure as a significant deviation or loss.
Broad ranges of percentages are provided for those cases in which calibrated assessment instruments or other standards are available to quantify the impairment in body function. For example, when ""no impairment"" or ""complete impairment"" in body function is coded, this scaling may have margin of error of up to 5%. ""Moderate impairment"" is generally up to half of the scale of total impairment. The percentages are to be calibrated in different domains with reference to population standards as percentiles. For this quantification to be used in a uniform manner, assessment procedures need to be developed through research.
For a further explanation of coding conventions in ICF, refer to Annex 2."

Renal insufficiency is caused by PUVs in approximately 10%-15% of children undergoing renal transplant, and approximately one third of patients born with PUVs progress to end-stage renal disease. Moreover, as a result of the obstructive process, increased collagen deposition and muscle hypertrophy can significantly thicken the bladder wall. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the detrusor muscle and increases in connective tissue limit bladder compliance during filling.	MONDO:0018559

Many children have characteristic superficial punctate lesions of the inferior-nasal aspects of their cornea that stain brightly with fluorescein. Early in the disease they are visible only through a slit-lamp examination. With more severe disease the punctate lesions become more numerous and spread upwards over the central cornea, and the corneal stroma becomes oedematous. Thick, keratinized plaques resembling Bitot's spot may form on the corneal surface. These are often densest in the interpalpebral zone. With treatment, these corneal plaques peel off, sometimes leaving superficial erosion which quickly heals. Corneal xerosis responds within 2-5 days to vitamin A therapy, the cornea regaining its normal appearance in 1-2 weeks.	MONDO:0001250|MONDO:0007016

Fazio-Londe syndrome is recessively inherited, a result of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the SLC52A3 gene. Patients may respond to therapy with riboflavin. 

NEW: Progressive bulbar paralysis of childhood (Fazio-Londe syndrome) is characterised by progressive bilateral facial paralysis with various other manifestations: ptosis, dysphagia, dysrhythmia, dyspnoea and frequent respiratory infections. It may become generalised, leading to paralysis, amyotrophy and abnormally sharp osteotendinous reflexes. The course is severe in cases of respiratory insufficiency. It is caused by neuronal loss in the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, at the level of the spinal bulb. Degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord has also been reported.

They include primary spontaneous pneumothorax without tension and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax without tension. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients without underlying pulmonary disease, classically in tall, thin young men in their teens and 20s. It is thought to be due to spontaneous rupture of subpleural apical blebs or bullae that result from smoking or that are inherited. It generally occurs at rest, although some cases occur during activities involving reaching or stretching. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax also occurs during diving and high-altitude flying because of unequally transmitted pressure changes in the lung. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients with underlying pulmonary disease. It most often results from rupture of a bleb or bulla in patients with severe COPD, HIV-related Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, cystic fibrosis, or any underlying pulmonary parenchymal disease. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is more serious than primary spontaneous pneumothorax because it occurs in patients whose underlying lung disease decreases their pulmonary reserve.

Additional information: This code is used by some as synonymous with the perimembranous, conoventricular, Type II, or the paramembranous defects. Although best used to describe the perimembranous defect that opens centrally at the base of the right ventricle, this term might be used to code perimembranous defects with inlet or outlet extension. It is recommended, however, that the more precise terms be used whenever possible for coding the latter lesions. It should also not be used to code an inlet ventricular septal defect, or the so-called atrioventricular canal ventricular septal defect. More specific terms exist for coding these entities. It is used by some to describe an isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defect without extension, although it is unlikely that perimembranous defects exist in the absence of deficiency of their muscular perimeter. The conoventricular ventricular septal defect with malalignment should be coded as an outlet defect, as should the perimembranous defect opening to the outlet of the right ventricle. Such defects can also extend to become doubly committed and juxta-arterial (conal septal hypoplasia) when there is also fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the arterial valves or when there is a common arterial valve. Specific codes exist for these variants, which ideally should not be coded using this term."	MONDO:0002070

Problems in interpersonal functioning seriously affect virtually all relationships and the ability and willingness to perform expected social and occupational roles is absent or severely compromised. Specific manifestations of personality disturbance are severe and affect most, if not all, areas of personality functioning. Severe Personality Disorder is often associated with harm to self or others, and is associated with severe impairment in all or nearly all areas of life, including personal, family, social, educational, occupational, and other important areas of functioning.

Ulcers are classically round to oval ""punched-out"" defects, as if a trephine or cork-borer had been applied to the eye. The surrounding cornea is generally xerotic but otherwise clear, and typically lacks the grey, infiltrated appearance of ulcers of bacterial origin. There may be more than one ulcer. Small ulcers are almost invariably confined to the periphery of the cornea, especially its inferior and nasal aspects. The ulceration may be shallow, but is commonly deep. Perforations become plugged with iris, thereby preserving the anterior chamber. In more advanced disease the necrotic stroma sloughs, leaving a large ulcer or descemetocele. As with smaller ulcers, this is usually peripheral and heals as a dense, white, adherent leukoma. With therapy, superficial ulcers often heal with surprisingly little scarring; deeper ulcers, especially perforations, form dense peripheral adherent leukomas."	MONDO:0001250|MONDO:0007016

MONDO:0975135	moderate personality disorder	icd11.foundation:758339377	MONDO:equivalentTo	Moderate personality disorder	All general diagnostic requirements for Personality Disorder are met. Disturbances affect multiple areas of personality functioning (e.g., identity or sense of self, ability to form intimate relationships, ability to control impulses and modulate behaviour). However, some areas of personality functioning may be relatively less affected. There are marked problems in most interpersonal relationships and the performance of most expected social and occupational roles is compromised to some degree. Relationships are likely to be characterised by conflict, avoidance, withdrawal, or extreme dependency (e.g., few friendships maintained, persistent conflict in work relationships and consequent occupational problems, romantic relationships characterised by serious disruption or inappropriate submissiveness). Specific manifestations of personality disturbance are generally of moderate severity. Moderate Personality Disorder is sometimes associated with harm to self or others, and is associated with marked impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, although functioning in circumscribed areas may be maintained.

This diagnosis is with the extravasation, or leakage, of blood into the areas in and around the vitreous humour of the eye. The vitreous humour is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye. A variety of conditions can result in blood leaking into the vitreous humour, which can cause impaired vision, floaters, and photopsia.	MONDO:0001660
