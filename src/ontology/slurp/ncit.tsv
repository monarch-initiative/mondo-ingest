MONDO:0957701	childhood cancer stage by toronto guidelines v2	NCIT:C198027	MONDO:equivalentTo	Childhood Cancer Stage by Toronto Guidelines v2	A term that refers to the staging of childhood cancers following the rules of the Toronto guidelines v2, 2019. The guidelines were developed to address the lack of consistent information on childhood cancer staging in population registries and are not intended to replace staging systems in clinical use. They include a two-tiered approach that provides less detailed criteria for registries with limited resources and/or limited data access (Tier 1) and more detailed criteria for better-resourced registries (Tier 2). They apply to acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, renal malignant tumors except renal cell carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, malignant bone tumors, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, testicular germ cell tumors, ovarian germ cell tumors, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. The following changes were noted to the original classification (v1, 2014): a staging system was no longer considered appropriate for acute myeloid leukemia; all renal tumors, with the exception of renal cell carcinomas, should use the endorsed staging systems for Wilms tumor; staging systems for osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma were combined into a single recommendation for all malignant bone tumors; a staging system was endorsed for astrocytomas; the S category (serum tumor markers) was confirmed as an integral part of TNM staging for testicular cancer in Tier 2 recommendations; and PRETEXT number was added to Tier 2 recommendations for hepatoblastoma.
